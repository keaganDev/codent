# codent
My personal blog. Codent is different from most other blogs out there, it's about teaching me - the blogger and novice  coder - and each other. It's an interactive experience that aims to remove the teacher at the front of the class and welcome anyone with something to say! Whether that be a mistake I have made or just an alternative solution to a problem.
