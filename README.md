# codent
My personal blog. Codent is different from most other blogs out there, it's about teaching me - the blogger and novice  coder - and each other. It's an interactive experience that aims to remove the teacher at the front of the class and welcome anyone with something to say!

Codent will be built using the popular Python programming language alongside the also popular Flask microframework. The reason I will be using Flask is that it's minimal and doesn't solve many problems for you - which is true to the project philosiphy which is all about learning - but rather offers a very pythonic workflow and a great variety of choice. I am not apposed to Python and other frameworks,I cannot even say confidently that I have made the correct choice since I don't have familiarity with other frameworks such as Django and Pyramid nevertheless it feels like the right choice for what I want to achieve. 

On codent I will upload an original post on my understanding of a particular subject and you all are invited to rip that post to shreds! The philosiphy being that I as a novice coder will be able to teach not only about the subjects I know but also teach through my mistakes. Hopefully this will help me you, and many other programmers gain an alternate viewpoint on a matter and correct any mistakes that we are oblivious to.

Codent will feature many feedback systems: regular comment sections; you're stupid sections - where you point out silly flaws in any aspect of the post; ratings on feedback which will be featured in the post if popular enough and even complete alternate posts linked to the original offering a complete overhaul of my perspective and execution of solving a particular problem.

I hope that offering this platform will allow programmers with similar interests to come together to more fully understand the problems we enjoy working on!

As an aside, since this project is going to be all about feedback, tell me if this is a stupid idea or recommend features that you think will help me realize my idea more completely.
